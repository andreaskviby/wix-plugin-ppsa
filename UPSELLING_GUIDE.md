# 🚀 **STOP Wasting Money on Marketing That Doesn't Work**

## The $50 Billion Attribution Problem That's Bleeding Your Profits Dry

> *"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half."* - John Wanamaker (1838-1922)

**This 100-year-old problem is STILL destroying businesses today.** 

Every day, **millions of e-commerce merchants** pour money into Facebook ads, Google campaigns, TikTok promotions, and influencer partnerships... **without knowing which channels actually drive profitable sales.**

## 💸 **The Harsh Reality Every E-Commerce Owner Faces**

- **84% of marketers** can't accurately attribute revenue to specific channels
- **$37 billion** is wasted annually on ineffective marketing campaigns
- **73% of businesses** admit they're "flying blind" with their ad spend
- **Average e-commerce store** wastes **32%** of their marketing budget on channels that don't convert

**Sound familiar?** You're not alone. But there's a solution that changes everything.

# 🎯 **Introducing the Post-Purchase Survey & Attribution Plugin**
### *The First Revenue-Tied Attribution Solution Built Specifically for Wix Stores*

**Imagine knowing EXACTLY which marketing channels drive your most valuable customers within 24 hours of launching.**

Our revolutionary plugin solves the attribution mystery by asking customers one simple question at the moment of highest satisfaction: **right after they buy.**

## ⚡ **How It Works (In 30 Seconds)**

1. **Customer completes purchase** → Thank you page appears
2. **Survey appears automatically** → "How did you hear about us?"
3. **One-click response** → TikTok, Instagram, Google, Friend, etc.
4. **Instant attribution** → Response tied to actual order value
5. **Marketing gold** → Data flows to your analytics & pixels

**Result:** You finally know your $5,000 Facebook ad budget is generating $15,000 in revenue, while your $2,000 TikTok spend is only driving $800 in sales.
